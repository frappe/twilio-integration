## Development

### Pre-requisites
- [ERPNext](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/introduction/getting-started-with-erpnext#4-install-erpnext-on-your-unixlinuxmac-machine
)
- Twilio account (More details from `Configure Twilio` section)

### Configure Twilio
* You need to create a [new project](https://www.twilio.com/console/projects/create)  in [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/) to use communication features like whatsapp, voice calls etc through ERPNext.

#### Twilio For Voice Calls
* From your Twilio console you can go to a [programmable voice](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/dashboard) section and get a Twilio number to use for calls(make sure that the number is voice capable).
* Create a [TwiML App](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/twiml/apps/create) by passing voice request url as `you_project_domain_name/api/method/twilio_integration.twilio_integration.doctype.twilio_settings.twilio_settings.voice` . Use `ngrok` to get  public domain for your project in case it is running locally.

#### Twilio For Whatsapp
* From your Twilio console you can go to a [Programmable Messaging](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/dashboard) section and get a Twilio number to use for whatsapp.


### How To Setup
Once you have created a site with ERPNext app installed, you can download and install twilio-integration app using

```
bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/twilio-integration.git
bench --site site_name install-app twilio-integration
```

Use `bench start` command to run the project.

#### Configure Twilio Settings Through Project's Admin Interface
* For Whatsapp communication you need to set `Account SID` and `Auth Token` in `Twilio Settings`(You can get those from Twilio console).
* For calls you need to pass `TwiML SID`(Get it from TwiML app you have created) and `Outgoing Voice Medium` along with `Account SID` and `Auth Token` in `Twilio Settings`
* Make sure that you enabled twilio by clicking `Enabled` checkbox in settings.

NOTE: While creating a new `communication medium` for `Outgoing Voice Medium` pass twilio number(including area code(ex:+91)) as Name, `Twilio` as communication channel and `Voice` as Communication Medium Type.
